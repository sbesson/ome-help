<h1>CLS OMERO Server</h1>
<p>CLS has an OMERO server, called Nightshade, that is available for use by all CLS staff and students to store, view and analyse image data.</p>

<p>An account will be automatically created for you when you log in for the first time.</p>

<p>This is easiest using the the Nightshade OMERO.web client in your usual browser:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nightshade.openmicroscopy.org" target="_blank">www.nightshade.openmicroscopy.org</a></p>

<p>The desktop client, OMERO.insight can be downloaded from the OMERO <a href="http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero5">Downloads</a> page.</p>

<p>When you have created your account, you will be in a &quot;default&quot; group. To be able to share your and colleague's data, you need to join your Lab or PI's group. Ask the group owner, usually a PI to add you to their group or email the OMERO <a href="mailto:mailto:sysadmin@openmicroscopy.org">systems administrator</a> and indicate which group(s) you would like to be in.</p>
<p>Note: As OMERO.insight is a stand-alone Java application, and does not require installation as such, you do not need administrator privileges to install it.</p>
<p>On Windows, expand the .ZIP archive and move the OMERO.clients folder to your Documents or home directory. </p>
<p>On the Mac expand the archive and drag it to the Applications folder.</p>
<p>Full &quot;Getting Started&quot; instructions specifically for using OMERO and Nightshade are on the <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/cls/index.html" target="_blank">CLS-Nighshade</a> page.</p>
<p>The OMERO <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/index.html" target="_blank">Help website</a> contains detailed help documents for common workflows.</p>
<p>Using OMERO  you can publish images stored on Nightshade directly on your website. See the <a href="http://help.openmicroscopy.org/cls/public-demo.html" target="_blank">Public Demo</a> page for details.</p>
